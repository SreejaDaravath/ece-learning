### r/electronics

**Title:** [OC] Made an interactive browser game to teach electronics - 50 levels from LEDs to logic gates

**Body:**

Hey r/electronics! I built a free web app to help people learn circuits hands-on.

**ECE MASTER** is a game where you drag components (batteries, LEDs, resistors, logic gates) onto a breadboard, connect wires, and watch circuits come to life with real-time simulation.

Features:
- 50 levels teaching voltage dividers, Ohm's law, logic gates, adders, etc.
- Real measurements (V, I, R, P)
- Draw smooth wires with your mouse
- Works offline as a PWA
- Fully open-source (MIT license)

### r/ECE

**Title:** Built a free interactive game to teach ECE fundamentals (50 levels, open-source)

**Body:**

Hi ECE community! I created **ECE MASTER**, a browser-based learning game that makes electronics education more interactive.

Why I built this:
- Traditional textbooks lack hands-on practice
- Students need intuitive circuit building before expensive lab equipment
- Wanted a free, accessible tool for global learners

What's inside:
- Levels 1-10: Basic circuits (LED, voltage dividers)
- Levels 11-30: Digital logic (gates, truth tables, adders)
- Levels 31-50: Advanced circuits (flip-flops, counters)

Technical stack:
- Vanilla JS (no frameworks, fast load)
- Canvas-based rendering
- Service worker for offline
- PWA installable

Live demo: https://yourusername.github.io/ece-master/
GitHub: https://github.com/yourusername/ece-master

Would love feedback from fellow ECE folks! What topics should I add next?
